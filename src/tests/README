Tests are composed of 4 Pfx programs organized as following:

Basic Pfx:

- error.pfx -> tests the handling of the error handling inappropriate characters

- errorbis.pfx -> it was formely to test the handling of passing to a new line in the handling of the error described above when we wrote the Pfx lexer

- first.pfx, prog0.pfx -> test the building and printing of Pfx ASTs
